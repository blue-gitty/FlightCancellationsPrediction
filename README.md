# FlightCancellationsPrediction
This projects agenda is to predict the cancellation of flights, based on a previous domestic flight dataset. 

## Flights.ipynb file 
It is a python executable file for the Flight Cancellation prediction model we built.

## EAI6000_Final_Group_Project (1).docx
It's the project report I and group Alpha contributed to for the Flight Cancellation prediction models.

## Please download the dataset from the below link:
```

```

#### Consider the file DelayedFlights.csv to work with

# Using the Codebase

1) Unzip the folder using the following command:

```
$ unzip FlightCancellationsPrediction.zip
```

2) cd to the newly unzipped folder.

```
$ cd FlightCancellationsPrediction
```

3) Utilize or create a python environment, I suggest we use Jupyter notebook


4) Run the code block by block to see the benchmark metrics for all the models we have used.
